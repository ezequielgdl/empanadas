This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the web app

Empanadas are a staple of every Argentinean friend reunion, but when it comes to ordering and remembering who ordered what that's when the conflict begins.
This empanada counter allows users to create sharable sessions that can be accessed by anyone with the unique link and add their order. The app logs each user's order on a global counter and displays each user's unique order on another panel, so nobody can steal anyone else's empanada.
